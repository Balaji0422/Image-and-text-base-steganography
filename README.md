#HIDE AND SEEK

Project Description

HIDE AND SEEK is a Java-based steganography application that securely hides secret messages inside digital images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. The goal is to provide a private and secure way to embed information within images to prevent unauthorized access or detection. Additional encryption options add layers of security to protect the confidentiality of the hidden messages. The application includes a user-friendly Java Swing GUI for intuitive interaction.

Features
1. Encoding and decoding messages embedded in image pixels using the LSB steganography method.
2. Optional encryption of messages before embedding ensures enhanced security.
3. Support for multiple formats of images for hiding messages.
4. Secure user authentication features, including password change functionality.
5. A secure chat module integrated for real-time encrypted communication.
6. Intuitive and visually organized GUI built with Java Swing components to ease usability.

Technologies Used
1. Java
2. Java Swing for GUI
3. Image processing techniques for steganography
4. Network programming for secure chat
5. JDBC for database connectivity (DBConnection.java)

How to Use
1. Run the HideAndSeekForm Java application to launch the main interface.
2. Use the provided GUI components to select an image and hide your secret message or decode a hidden message.
3. Utilize the secure chat feature (SimpleSecureChatTabbed) for encrypted messaging.
4. Manage user credentials with the password change form for added account security.
5. To run the code there is and folder structure there is source.txt inside the src folder please refer that.

Applications

1. Educational tool for learning steganography and secure communication techniques.
2. Secure message embedding in images to protect sensitive information.
3. Digital privacy enhancement and confidential data transmission between users.
